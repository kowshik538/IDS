You are my senior developer. I want you to fully transform this project into a complete, production-ready, platform-independent, enterprise-grade intrusion detection system called AgisFL. Use all source code from my GitHub project (which includes the SIDS core federated learning engine) and make sure everything is working perfectly, including real-time system/network monitoring, model training, dashboard visualizations, and cross-platform compatibility.

Tasks:

1. ✅ Fully integrate the missing SIDS core (from my GitHub repo) into this Replit project and ensure all federated learning features work as intended.
2. ✅ Fix the “Threat” page, “Network Analysis”, and “Federated Learning” tabs so they display live data and work without any bugs or blank screens.
3. ✅ Ensure the system captures and uses real-time system and network traffic data — not dummy/static data — using Scapy or equivalent.
4. ✅ Fix the issue of constant pop-up messages or alerts — remove any excessive frontend notifications that disrupt user flow.
5. ✅ Make the entire application platform-independent:
   - Works on Windows, Linux, macOS
   - Use SQLite or easily configurable DB
   - No Replit or platform lock-in
6. ✅ Add installation scripts:
   - `setup.bat` for Windows
   - `setup.sh` for Linux/macOS
   - Auto-setup virtual environments and dependencies
7. ✅ Add basic authentication and login/logout pages if not already present.
8. ✅ Clean up the codebase:
   - Remove Replit-specific dependencies
   - Fix all import errors, runtime bugs, and logging issues
   - Improve file organization
9. ✅ Improve performance and UI/UX:
   - Smooth loading of dashboard
   - Responsive layout
   - Proper loading states, no abrupt data pops
10. ✅ Add essential documentation:
   - README with full setup steps
   - Basic usage guide
   - How to test or simulate intrusion attempts
11. ✅ Add modular logging and error handling (don’t crash the app on minor issues).
12. ✅ Ensure the backend handles:
    - Training models
    - Evaluating threats
    - Live packet parsing
    - Logging detections

Finally, **critically evaluate** the entire application like a real-world product and improve anything that prevents it from being rated 1000 out of 100. I want it polished, secure, functional, and ready for a real-world demo, presentation, or deployment.

Summarize changes at the end, and do not stop until everything works and it meets all criteria above.
